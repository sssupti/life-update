            <h1 style="color:black;"> LIFE LATELY </h1>
			<p> The alarm annoyingly started ringing,'five more minutes' I said.Cold wind was blowing through the open window chilling my bone,I couldn't sleep any longer.I dragged myself out of the bed and stood next to the window,it was a foggy morning.I wanted nothing more than sleeping during that time,but it was time for college.I've been doing the same thing repeatedly
since last month.Even a month ago,life was so stress-free,so relaxing...life was different.I've never set an alarm before to wake up on time.Back in April,in a sunny summer morning,my mother came to my room and called me by my name.She opened the windows,moving away the curtains and said"wake up!Do you remember what day it is? Eid Mubarak!".Following, she cuddled me."Hurry up!You don't want to miss the desserts"."So what do we have for breakfast today?" I asked."I believe you want to find that out yourself,don't you?Come on now and don't you want to meet your father before he leaves for prayer?".Then she kissed me on my forehead and started to make my bed.</p>
<p>Mornings used to be like that.My life has changed so much since I've moved to Dhaka.Now I wake up on my own,find my breakfast on my own,prepare lessons and bathe on time without anybody reminding me.Last night,I talked with my mother,my father,my grandmother,my aunt over a video call."It has been a long time since I last saw you,you somehow look different", said my grandmother and she immediately started sobbing."Hey,grandma!why are you crying?I haven't left home forever you know.I'll return as soon as I get time".Right after that,a realisation came across my mind,haven't I really left home permanently?Aren't I just a guest on vacations there now?When again am I going to live there for months? Later that night,I prepared my bed,turned the lights off and lied down.I wasn't sleepy.I closed my eyes and went through a lot of memories."Hey did you prepare your Physics homework today?I absolutely forgot!What do I do now?Could you please help me with your copy?" "So what's on tiffin today?I'm going to eat the extra tiffin today" "No way!<b><i> You</i></b> were the one to have it yesterday.Today's extra tiffin is mine" "Ok then we'll share!" "Hangout after school?It's always boring to go home right after school." "Hey have you heard of this new place? We got to explore it.On Monday evening?" "Alright!" "I had a bad day today" "What happened?Did anything happen at home?Did someone hurt you?You look pale."...were some of the everyday conversations between my friends and I.                       </p>		
<p>And then I thought about my college days.How are they going? Well,I go to college every morning,find my fixed seat,seat down and attend classes.What about tiffin time?I go to the cantin and grab my tiffin.Sitting down at the basketball ground while eating my tiffin,I see vehicles going through the elevated expressway.I don't know why but I always find it very smooth and satisfying.
Sometimes I go to the library.It's such a gorgeous place!Well actually,I find the whole college very gorgeous,beautiful paintings,wooden craftwork,framed <b><i>NAKSHI KANTHA </i></b> in every corner of the college!
All of those are so eye-soothing!I have every possible opportunity here,everything is gorgeous.But I still miss something,where are my friends? With them that old dull school building felt so colorful,every single moment was colorful!And now?Even 
in this colorful place,everything feels monochromatic.</p>
<p>Surprisingly,I found out I was weeping.Well,I do that often now.</p>
